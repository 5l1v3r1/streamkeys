## Music player hotkeys
This is a simple script to send "global" (ie. across the browser) hotkeys to various online media players.<br>

##Default hotkeys:

MAC:
* Ctrl + Shift + 2: Toggle play/pause
* Ctrl + Shift + 1: Previous song
* Ctrl + Shift + 3: Next Song
* Cmd + Shift + M: Toggle mute

WINDOWS/LINUX
* Mediakeys: play/pause, next, previous
* Ctrl + Shift + M: mute

##Info:

This extension works by sending click events to the elements that control the music player. Content scripts are used to capture key presses and interact with the pages DOM. The background script routes hotkey presses from a content script to the correct tab, ie., the media player(s) tab

##TODO:

* Redo tab stack
* Add possibility of calling functions to onclick of BaseController
* See if media keys can work with mac
* ~~Test the new global hotkeys in Chrome v34 (stable)~~ (works)
* ~~Test on Ubuntu/Linux~~ (works)
* See if it can work with embedded players (ie. soundcloud). Maybe check for existence of some element, if found add tab to stack (should be done after load)?
* Add Youtube
* ~~Add VK~~ (added)
* ~~Add options page to enable/disable sites~~
* Add iheartradio
* Add mixcloud
